# Learned pitfalls:
- Need to change is_atari to use unregistered environments
- Make sure the action and observation space are accurate
- Make sure `reset()` returns ONLY obs! 

# TODO

- Performance breakdown of model submission
- Fix model preview issue (model output not used correctly)
- Somehow, the particles' movements aren't that random (i.e. change of direction is constant)
